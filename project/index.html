            <h2>About American Girl History</h2>
            <p>American Girl History is a project dedicated to collecting knowledge of American Girl dolls in one place.
                American Girl is a brand of 18-inch dolls that focuses on teaching history and creating memorable
                characters through its products. While it was originally called Pleasant Company after its founder,
                Pleasant Rowland, the company was purchased by Mattel in 2002 and is currently sold under the American
                Girl brand name. American Girl is known for its research and quality, especially regarding its
                historical line, which features dolls that represent fictional girls who lived in historical eras from
                1764-1999. It also has a contemporary line called Girl of the Year, which has continued since 2001, a
                baby doll line called Bitty Baby, and a line of 14-inch dolls called Welliewishers.</p>
            <p>American Girl History focuses on the historical line of dolls, originally called The American Girls
                Collection, as well as the history of the company itself. The website contains ways to filter the dolls
                by several different categories and contains pictures and further information about each of the
                dolls. It also has a timeline page that contains a timeline of the company. It also has a contact page
                for people seeking further information that isn't available on the main website. AG History is run by
                Brita, a high school senior who thinks American Girl dolls are cool and wants to share her small pool of
                knowledge with everyone.</p>
