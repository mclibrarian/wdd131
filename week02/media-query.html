            <p>Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, let us cheerfully do all things that lie in our
                power; and then may we stand still, with the utmost assurance, to see the salvation
                of God, and for his arm to be revealed.</p>

            <h2>Omni 1:26</h2>
            <p>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy
                One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come
                unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting
                and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</p>
